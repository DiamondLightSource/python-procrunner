Versatile utility function to run external processes

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://procrunner.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* runs an external process and waits for it to finish
* does not deadlock, no matter the process stdout/stderr output behaviour
* returns the exit code, stdout, stderr (separately, both as bytestrings),
  and the total process runtime as a dictionary
* process can run in a custom environment, either as a modification of
  the current environment or in a new environment from scratch
* stdin can be fed to the process, the returned dictionary contains
  information how much was read by the process
* stdout and stderr is printed by default, can be disabled
* stdout and stderr can be passed to any arbitrary function for
  live processing (separately, both as unicode strings)
* optionally enforces a time limit on the process
